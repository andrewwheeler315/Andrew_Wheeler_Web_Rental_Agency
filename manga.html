                <p>Ichigo Kurosaki has always been able to see ghosts, but this ability doesn't change his life nearly
                    as much
                    as his close encounter with Rukia Kuchiki, a Soul Reaper and member of the mysterious Soul Society.
                    While
                    fighting a Hollow, an evil spirit that preys on humans who display psychic energy, Rukia attempts
                    to lend
                    Ichigo some of her powers so that he can save his family; but much to her surprise, Ichigo absorbs
                    every
                    last drop of her energy. Now a full-fledged Soul Reaper himself, Ichigo quickly learns that the
                    world he
                    inhabits is one full of dangerous spirits and, along with Rukia--who is slowly regaining her
                    powers--it's
                    Ichigo's job to protect the innocent from Hollows and help the spirits themselves find peace.</p>
